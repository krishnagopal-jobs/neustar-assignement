This is created as the solution of assignment given by Neustar.

I didn't include the factory pattern while creating implementation of interfaces. Because the project is very small.
In real time project where they may exist many implementation for single interface, I include factory pattern.

If there can be more number of factories possible, then I would include abstract factory pattern.
